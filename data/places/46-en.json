  "desc":"      <p>For his fable, Pasolini chose two actors of highly particular profiles: Tot\u00f2, a legendary actor of Italian comedy, and Ninetto, a non-actor, an uneducated man from the Roman suburbs, whom he met on the shooting of <a href='#!\/en\/map\/34'><em>La Ricotta<\/em><\/a>, which had been the non-professional's first film.<\/p>      <p>The mechanics of the duo was fantastic, although it was no sure thing. Tot\u00f2, who had invented aristocratic origins for himself, lived in Parioli, the most chic, most bourgeois quarter of Rome. Invited to dinner at the star's home, Ninetto arrived in jeans, looking downright slovenly... to the point that, after dinner, Tot\u00f2 asked that Ninetto's armchair be cleaned with pesticide! In the end, the relationship between the three men would be idyllic. Pasolini, Ninetto and Tot\u00f2 found and tamed each other, despite the differences in class and profession.<\/p>      <p><em>Uccellacci e uccellini<\/em> was built on a brilliant intuition: speaking about the crisis in Marxist ideology, the left, the end of neo-realistic cinema, and Rossellini, through a picaresque fable. Pasolini's tale is quite bitter but clear-sighted and premonitory. He had understood the situation, the death of ideology and commitment, before the official left did.<\/p>      ",
