  "desc":"      <p>On the night of 1-2 November 1975, Pier Paolo Pasolini's body was found, atrociously mutilated, on the beach of Ostia. Up to the present day, the conditions of his death remain very vague even though his alleged murderer, Giuseppe (Pino) Pelosi, gave a detailed version of that tragic evening at the time.<\/p>      <p>In the early evening, Pasolini dined with Ninetto Davoli at the Pommidoro restaurant (Piazza dei Sanniti, 44) before going off, said he, to a meeting.<\/p>      <p>In his first version, Pelosi related having met Pasolini in the area around the Termini station, then allegedly went for a drive across Rome, finally going to 'Al Biondo Tevere' (Via Ostianse, 178), a popular restaurant on the road to the beach at Ostia.<\/p>      <p>This narrative contains a large share of incoherencies and grey areas and, contrary to the thesis of simple homosexual violence that went bad, it is the theory of an organized ambush that is the most probable. There are many grey areas in the itinerary of the two men and in the actual unfolding of the evening.<\/p>      <p>The most likely hypothesis is that his death cannot be reduced to a simple homosexual news item but was rather the lynching of a committed, militant, provocative man whose unique voice, strong, anti-establishment and particularly influential, was dangerous for the Italian power in place at the time.<\/p>      <p>Going back on his initial declarations, Pelosi subsequently mentioned the two Borsellino brothers, linked to the far right, and two or three unknown Sicilians.<\/p>      <p>The magistracy has reopened the investigation several times over the past few years.<\/p>      ",
