The cinematic heritage is coupled with a geographical reference: only some dozen metres separate the shooting locations of the two films.<\/p>      <p>These days, Pigneto has changed considerably, having become a fashionable neighbourhood, swarming with painters and young artists.<\/p>      <blockquote>On a miserable road, surrounded by shacks, old cottages, full of tattered little kids, under a furious sun, a sad, desolate bell tolled the knell.<br \/>Accattone advanced down the road pummeled by the sun.<br \/>He truly was an accattone [beggar], in a singlet with dusty trousers.<br \/>Around his neck, there was no longer the thick gold chain.<br \/>On his fingers, there was no longer a ring either.<br \/>On his wrist there was no longer a bracelet or a watch. Naked as a worm.<br \/>He walked down the empty, blinding road, under the bell tolling the knell.<\/blockquote>      <cite>Excerpt from the script<\/cite>      ",
