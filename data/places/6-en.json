  "desc":"     <p>In 1951, Pasolini earned his living as best he could, writing bits of scripts and a few articles for various magazines. The writings mounted up to the point of gradually giving shape to his first novel: <em>Ragazzi di vita<\/em>, THE novel about post-war Rome. To gather information about the proletarian youth of the capital and shore up his writings, Pasolini extended his peregrinations to the inner suburbs: Trastevere, of course, as well as Monteverde Nuovo, otherwise called 'Zona di Donna Olimpia'.<\/p>      <p>Pasolini's bonds of friendship with the young neighbourhood delinquents grew stronger, to the point that he decided to move to Monteverde Nuovo, at 86 via Fonteiana, in March 1954. It was also in that neighbourhood that Pasolini would hit it off with the brothers Franco and Sergio Citti, two young house painters who taught the poet about the language and customs of the Roman suburbs. This encounter would radically change the life of the two brothers: Sergio would become a scriptwriter, then filmmaker. And several years later, Franco would play the role of Accattone in <a href=\"#!\/en\/map\/16\">the eponymous film<\/a>.<\/p>      <blockquote>I don't believe there was or is a single God. If I had to love one, it would instead be Pasolini.<\/blockquote>      <cite>Franco Citti, <em>Vita di un ragazzo di vita<\/em><\/cite>      ",
