  "desc":"    <blockquote>Pier Paolo became Roman, even though he maintained a certain critical and linguistic distance towards Rome. He acquired a profound knowledge of Romanesco, but it goes without saying that he didn't speak it like Sergio Citti or me; he made literary use of it, he used the free indirect discourse in the style of Gadda; to a certain degree, he mimed this dialect. He made you feel all the flavour of this reality but gave a representation of it that had nothing naturalistic about it.<\/blockquote>    <cite>Interview with Vincenzo Cerami, a former student of Pasolini's in <a href='#!\/en\/map\/4'>Ciampino<\/a>, scriptwriter and writer<\/cite>    <p>Pasolini's writings and films created a new imaginative universe of the Italian capital. Pasolini did not settle for integrating the city as a background for his novels and films, he 'recast' Rome through literature and cinema. By frequenting the young people of the <em>borgate<\/em> \u2013&nbsp;those of Quarticciolo, for example&nbsp;-, he gave an existence and a literary dignity to the Romanesco dialect, which, thanks to him, entered the great Italian culture.<\/p>      ",
