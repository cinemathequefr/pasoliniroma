  "desc":"      <p>In Italy at the end of the Sixties, Pasolini was one of the most powerful protestors against the television medium. Like a Marshall McLuhan, the filmmaker viewed television as a source of disinformation and the 'dis-education' of an increasingly passive public. Pasolini's coup will have been to contest television within it. Invited by Enzo Biagi, a famous journalist of the <em>Corriere della Sera<\/em>, he contested the journalist and the media system live during the broadcast on which he was a guest.<\/p>      <p>Pasolini would especially develop this critical discourse in his documentary <em>The Rage of Pasolini<\/em>. A founding text, entirely in verses, was read by the painter <a href=\"#!\/en\/map\/57\">Renato Guttuso<\/a> and the famous writer Giorgio Bassani , a close friend of Pasolini's. These two non-professional voices were a bit 'dirty' but particularly expressive.<\/p>      ",
