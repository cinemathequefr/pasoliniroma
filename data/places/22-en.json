  "desc":"      <p>Shot in the inner suburbs of Rome, Pasolini's first film makes a few forays into the city centre. Already glimpsed seven years earlier in Federico Fellini's <em>The White Sheik<\/em> (the scene of Wanda's abortive suicide attempt), the banks of the Tiber and the Sant'Angelo bridge again serve as a film location. And offer <em>Accattone<\/em> its first shots.<\/p>       <p>It is from this bridge, which leads to the Castel Sant'Angelo, the 'big Vatican beast', that the hero decides to dive: a senseless act of bravura, anything but gratuitous. As Franco Citti recalls it in <em>A futura Memoria<\/em>, Accattone's dive is also a means for the Roman proletariat to remind the bourgeoisie living in the city centre of its existence. If Accattone came to die in his suburb, no one would ever know anything. But there, right in the heart of Rome, he exposes his miserable existence and free will in full view of everyone.<\/p>      ",
