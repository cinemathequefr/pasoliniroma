  "desc":"      <p>Even though he did not live in Cecafumo, Pasolini knew the neighbourhood perfectly, like other quarters of Rome. As a veritable anthropologist, he was going to recognize and discover in depth the inner suburbs that would serve him as locations \u2013 for his films as well as for his poems and novels. These choices were thought out, desired and coherent \u2013 no approximations.<\/p>      <p>When, in Mamma Roma, Pasolini filmed Cecafumo, which adjoins the magnificent Park of Aqueducts and its archaeological ruins, it was not by chance \u2013 there is a discourse. Pasolini contrasts the Rome that he senses arriving with repulsion, that of the lower-middle-class transformation of the early Sixties, with Ancient Rome. He opposes the great Rome, that of a sublimated past, with the 20th-century Rome of working-class estates, built in series to pack in workers. It is a powerful contrast on a purely stylistic level, as well as in symbolic and ideological dimensions.<\/p>      <p>This antagonism will be found again in <a href='#!\/en\/map\/34'>La Ricotta<\/a>, also partially shot in Cecafumo.<\/p>      ",
