It was a few streets from this second flat that Pier Paolo Pasolini's funeral service would be celebrated: in the Campo de' Fiori.<\/p><p>This flat on via Montoro, with its lovely terrace and a lift opening directly onto the living room, was the last 'salon' of Roman intellectual life. No one would have dared decline an invitation from 'La Betti' to share the spaghetti that she herself prepared for her guests who included everyone from Italian cinema, all the writers, and all the visiting intellectuals..<\/p><p>After the death of her friend, Laura Betti would devote herself to his memory, within the Pier Paolo Pasolini Foundation, up until her own death in 2004.<\/p><p>The place still exists to the present day.<\/p>      ",
