I've decided to take her to Rome as of tomorrow, at my father's instigation, and entrust her to my uncle; I'll be unable to stay in Rome, because my uncle made it clear that he couldn't put me up, but I hope that for my mother things will be different. From Rome, I don't know where I'll go, perhaps to Florence. As you see, I find myself in a very sad situation (....). So if you want to write me something, my address, at least for a few days, will be: c\/o Gino Colussi, via Porta Pincinia, 34 Rome. After that, I don't know where I'll go or what I'll do. My life is at a more-than-decisive turning point.<\/blockquote>      <cite>Last letter written in Casarsa, 27 January 1950, sent to his friend Silvana Mauri<\/cite>      <p>Pasolini and his mother left their house in Casarsa in the evening and arrived at the Termini station on a freezing morning of 28 January 1950... <em>'Poor as a cat in the Coliseum,'<\/em> as he would later write in one of his first and most famous Roman poems.<\/p>      ",
